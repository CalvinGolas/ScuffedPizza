To run this, go into the /ScuffedPizza folder.

After spinning up the venv, type: "export FLASK_APP=rflask".
Then in a seperate terminal run "./ngrok http 5000" and visit the
bottommost .io link next to forwarding.

WARNING!!! Since I uploaded this with twilio authentication keys, they shut down my account momentarily so running the instructions above won't work off the bat. I have a working copy on my computer using another account though, so we're still good!
